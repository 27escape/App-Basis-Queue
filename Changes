v 000.600.100 2017-12-11
    * marking project as EOL
v 000.600.000 2016-08-30
    * peek method can take a count
v 000.500.000 2016-03-15
    * new method peek for task queues, lets you see what is at the head or tail of the queue
    * new 'simple' queue operations, provides push, pop and size methods (queue_size is just for tasks)
    * queue is now optional for most calls, default_queue can be defined when instancing the queue object
    * process and process_failures can take callback_params hash to pass optional parameters to the callback, saves using global variables
    * published items can have expiry times
    * times as parameters can be parsable strings, eg 'tomorrow', '2016-01-03 12:45', also if time is a number less than the number of seconds in 5 days, then this is added to the current time
    * Improved POD

  * pub-sub features
  * semantic version number
